% monero_profitability.m% (cc) BY Pete Laric / PeteLaric.com% A simple MATLAB/Octave script to compute the profitability (or lack thereof)% of mining Monero, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.  Edit the variables as% necessary for your own purposes.  Remember that, even if you are operating% at a net loss, it isn't necessarily a waste of time.  Mining XMR strengthens% the security of the Monero network, and if you were planning to buy XMR% anyway, this gives you the opportunity to acquire it without going through% an exchange or trusted intermediary.
